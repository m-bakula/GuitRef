# GuitRef

### What is GuitRef?
GuitRef (Guitar Reference) is an in-development Python app designed to help guitar players and musicians visually learn notes and patterns on a guitar fretboard, independent of number of strings or tuning. They are generated dynamically which is intended to limit reliance on memorizing chord charts and scale patterns, and encourage exploring the beautiful structure behind music. Readable and customizable user interface will be an integral part of the project.

### What are the features right now?
* Instrument independent backend library for operations on notes, scales, chords and keys, (e.g. adding/removing notes, finding intervals between notes)
* Editable lists of scales, chords and keys that can be loaded and used

### What are the planned features?
* A clean and customizable user interface with color coding
* Ability to accomodate any (reasonable) number of strings and tunings
